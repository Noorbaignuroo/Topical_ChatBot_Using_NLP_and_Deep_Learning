# Topical ChatBot Using NLP and Deep Learning

![Chatbot](chatbot_image.jpg)

This repository contains code and resources for building a Topical ChatBot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. The ChatBot is designed to engage in text-based conversations on specific topics by understanding user queries and providing relevant responses. The dataset used for training and fine-tuning the ChatBot is "intents.json."

## Project Overview

A topical ChatBot is a valuable tool for various applications, including customer support, information retrieval, and interactive experiences. This project focuses on creating a ChatBot that can effectively respond to user queries related to specific topics or domains.

## Dataset: intents.json

The "intents.json" dataset is a JSON file that provides the training data for the ChatBot. It includes the following components:

- **Intents**: Each intent represents a specific topic or user query category. For example, there may be intents for "Greetings," "FAQs," "Product Information," and more.

- **Patterns**: These are example user queries or messages related to each intent. Patterns help the ChatBot understand the type of questions or statements it might encounter.

- **Responses**: Corresponding responses for each intent. When the ChatBot identifies a user query, it selects an appropriate response from this list.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python**: You should have Python installed on your system.

- **Jupyter Notebook (Optional)**: For running and experimenting with code, Jupyter Notebook is recommended.

- **Deep Learning Framework**: Install the necessary deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, as specified in the project code.

- **NLP Libraries**: You'll need libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers for natural language processing tasks.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the "intents.json" dataset. This involves data cleaning, tokenization, and text preprocessing.

2. **Model Architecture**: Implement a deep learning model architecture suitable for the ChatBot's task. This typically includes components like word embeddings, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformer models.

3. **Training**: Train the ChatBot model using the preprocessed dataset. Fine-tune the model for better understanding of user queries and responses.

4. **Inference**: Implement inference logic to interact with the ChatBot. This involves taking user input, processing it, and generating appropriate responses.

5. **Evaluation**: Assess the ChatBot's performance by having conversations and evaluating its responses. Fine-tune the model if necessary.

6. **Deployment (Optional)**: If applicable, deploy the ChatBot in a real-time environment where users can interact with it.

## Usage

You can explore and run the project code in the provided Jupyter Notebook(s) to understand the implementation details and experiment with different settings.
